TH E colored legislators.
who ’’hey Were and What They Did.
of Hon John P. Green of Ohio at the Douglass,
Banjuet, in Washington, Jan 1.
Mb (^airman: This day stands conspicuous
amongst the proudest of my life. To have
one’s name associated with an occasion of this
nature and magnitude is an honor such as
seldom falls to the lot of an ordinary man.
The time, the place, the subject, all conspire
‘o make this an event of historical import
* . and were Ito regard the invitation by
virtue of which I am here in any light other
than as a tribute to the ambitious aims and
laudable aspirations of the younger portion
of tne present generation, 1 would be, indeed,
Guilty of a degree of egotism most unpardon
able. However, let us take a cursory glance
at “ the colored man as a legislator,” and in
doing so, we must necessarily be brief. The
advent of the colored legislatoi in the south,
during the early part of the last decade, was
an experiment; and when we take into con
sideration all the peculiar circumstances at
^gpding it, the wonder is that it did not result
iwLnmplete failure. But, while there is visi
le to\the student of history much that is
ooi reflection, yet the general result
fa s good; u^r the reason that it contributed,
n a great degt ^ e> toward the restoration of
^der out of cu %os an j obedience to law
Inhereveiled. In some sections
lof the south a‘iX v ; t of the legislators were
colored men; andW gret to say that many
of these were not only ignorant and illiterate,
but absolutely dishonest. A general desire
seemed to possess the people to be legislators;
udeach vied with the other, from the minis
ter in the pulpit to the laborer on the planta
tion, in their efforts to consummaK their de
^res. In the fall of 1872, out of twenty can
didates for legislative honors (?) in Marlbor
oagh county, South Carolina, only two could
nad' undone unfortunate who did not suc
ceed’in securing a re-electing to the legisla
ture wept, and ^turned again in the capacity
of janitor and aid menial service. The re
sult of this ignorance and incompetency may
be readily imagined; poor men became sud
denly rich on small salaries; and not only
owned palatial residences, but rode behind
spirited steeds, clothed in costly robes and
furred gowns; great funds were squandered,
and state debts piled up, while the statute
books showed many corporations for gain
wherein tlie names of the legislators them
sehes figured conspicuously as stockholders.
It is no wonder that the suspicions of the
whole people were aroused, public sympathy
withdrawn, and the reins of government per
nittad to fall into the hands of ex-slavehold
ers. But the colored legislators were not
alone to blame for all this corruption; they
not only had to bear much of the odium re
sufttingfem the misdeeds of their white col
leagues, but were denied the sympathy and
support of the intelligent classes of the south;
who, instead of joining hands with the law
making power and contributing of their su
perior skill and experience in one grand ef
fort to restore peace. harmony and prosperity
to the prostrate and disorganized south, stood
aloof, treated their experimental efforts at
government with studied scorn, and left them
to succeed as best they could.
Let us turn from this sad picture to a
I cheerful one:
Lisgels are bright still, though the brightest fell;
all things foul would wear the brows of grace,
^^■etgrace must look so.
■ Though many foul deeds have been perpe-
Kiied by dishonest men in the garb of legisla
■oß,yet they do not detract one iota from the
yrliuessof the pure legislator, who has near to
• heart the greatest good to the greatest
■aber. Even in some of the legislative
■lies of the south wete to be seen men pos
yd of such a degree of natural sagacity
intellectual culture as would have shown
■idvantage by the side of some of the best
^■ndsin the north, and could not be swerved
■mm the right path by bribes and threats.
■ Ibis is especially true of the colored legis
■itorin of congress, and I have jet to learn of
■oneconspicuous failure on his’part, acting in
■w capacity. To particularize as to colored
ygressmen would be invidious where all
^■quilted themselves so well; but may we not
Mpint with pardonable pride to the record of
-W veteran legislator, Joseph H. Rainey,
through a period of nine consecutive
jprs in congress kept his “ honor bright,”
delivered up his high trust amidst the
■ptaits of the whole nation, as the honorable
the Uouse of Representatives
■wj? ii 1110 P ublicl y for distinguished and
■“ e services rendered at a critical mo
■heri? Is it not meet at this time that the
■aae of that other colored legislator, should
Ke mentioned in ne uncertain way ?
IMr Chairman, I would that I could at this
■me recall a picture, once so vividly portray
■d to the astonishment of the American peo
■ie. O, it was majestic! Yes, it was grand!
■top a moment and reflect. Here at the nation’s
■capital, where only yesterday guys, blows
■and insults were the portion of the colored
I mencan and would-be statesmen croaked
iceir dissent from any plan looking toward
she amelioration of their condition, and
atched out startling theories, involving
feds as to the Negro’s humanity; here,
Wm the nation’s great hall of legislation,
Founded by the representatives of 50,000,-
■of people, while the ministers of earth’s
■Bed heads looked approvingly on, Robert
•Pott, a full-blooded Negro, stood forth

uscomtiure of his antagonist, that

of demeanor and integrity of purpose won the
esteem of all, without regard to color or polit
ical creed. His name will go adown the ages
side by side with our country’s purest and
best men.
At present we have but two colored men in
congress, Robert Smalls and John R. Lynch;
but if their past record is a just criterion of
their future actions, the cause of the colored
legislator will suffer no detriment at their
hands.
The noble-hearted north is making admir
able advancement in the way of promoting
her colored sons to legislative' positions. Al
ready in the great states of Massachusetts,
Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Kansas and Colorado
colored men have been elevated to their legal
sphere of action, and, some of them are at
this time serving acceptably. And, Mr chair
man, I believe we are on the threshold of an
era full of life and hope for the colored man;
an era where the colored legislator will, in no
sense, be a “barren ideality,” but with in
creased numbers and inteligence his influence
will be felt and acknowledged in the land.
Cosmopolitan in his feelings, liberal in his
ideas, and imbued with great reverence not
only for human enactments but for the source
of all law, he will be the ideal legislator of
this grand land.
DETROIT LETTER.
Social and Political—Colored Teach
ers in White Schools.
Special Correspondence of The Globe.
Detroit, Jan B.—We have not lacked for
enjoyment or pleasure during the holidays;
on the contrary the season has been unusual
ly active. On Christmas evening, the Sun
day school of the 2nd Baptist Church, Crog
han street, had a Christmas tree and festival.
On the events of Dec 27, the Sunday school
of Bethel M. E. Church had a like entertain
ment, as did also the Sunday school of St
Matthews P, E. Mission. The entertainment
of the latter was held in St Andrew’s Hall.
St Matthews is an enterprising little mission,
and it has now in process of erection, an
elegant little chapel, which in beauty and fin
ish will not be excelled by any church of
either race, of its size or kind in the city.
The Elite social club gave their annual so
cial at the residence of Mr and Mrs Finney,
Croghan street, on the evening of Dec 28.
It was a very nice affair, and all present
seemed to have enjoyed themselves. A pil
low case and sheet party was entertained at
the residence of Mrs Simpson, South street,
on the evening of the 29. New Year’s day
was one which we “lords of creation” had
long looked for, and had laid by great expec
tations. The weather was fine, and except
a light fall of snow early in the afternoon,
was' all that could be desired. The ladies
gathered together in groups to receive the
caU| o* their gentlemen friends, and perhaps
thiFfact more than any other accounted for
the scarcity of the single caller. The day was a
quiet one, no rioting or ruffianism of any
kind was seen in our streets. It was after
1 o’clock when your correspondent in com
pany with several others started on our
round of New Year’s calls. The ladies were
at their best,and seemed to emulate each other
in courtecies shown to their callers. Their
tables were laden down with tempting viands,
fruits, etc., what wonder then if we were
gorged and suffered on the next day. What
pleased us most however was the absence of
wine and other liquors, for ours was a tem
perance crowd. We never enjoyed ourselves
better or fared so well, but the day at last
came to an end as all things natural must.
Among the strangers in our city whom we
met this day worthy of mention, not because
they possessed more abilities, but because
their pc ition in life was such as to mark
them as ^eing in the van of a new epoch in
the history of our people, was Miss Minerva
Edwards of Bay City, Mich., who graduated
from the high school in 1881. In conversa
tion with her she said: “ The first year they
placed me in the primary department. Some
parents of the children objected at first and
withdrew their children, but then they were
glad to send them back. Last year I was
made assistant in the fifth and sixth grades.
Among my pupils I number some from the
first families of the city. No, Ido not have
any trouble now, at all.” Miss Edwards is a
very pleasant little lady, and “ accomplish
ments are native to her.” The fact of her
being a teacher in the white schools of Bay
City, (a city of 22,000 inhabitants), reflects
credit upon its school board, who looked not
at the color or race, but at the intelligence
and capability of the applicant and awarded
the position accordingly. But Bay City is
not the only city in our state which employs
a colored teacher. We have a veteran teach
er in our midst, Miss Fannie Richards, who
has been teaching in the public schools ever
since the abolition of the colored schools in
1870. Is Michigan the bannar state in this
respect ? Correspondents and readers of The
Globe in other states, can you furnish a par
allel case? If so, we in the west would like
to hear from you through the columns of this
our favorite paper. The other person referr
ed to above is Prof T. S. Boston of Chicago,
111., who has recently been appointed by the
Western Branch of the Mason & Hamlin Or
gan and Piano Co., whose headquarters are in
Chicago, as travelling agent. Mr Boston is a
graduate of the Chicago College of Medicine,
has practised a little in his profession, is a
good musician, very affable in his manners,
and possesses all the requisite qualities to suc
ceed in such a position. He seems to be a
progressive young man, and we wish him all
success in his new field. We saw a clipping
from the Chicago Inter-Ocean which praises
the Professor highly, and marks the appoint
ment as a new era in the history of our people.
The ladies’ social club gave their New
Year’s social in the evening of that day.
Finney’s band discoursed sweet music and the
hours passed merrily away. Mr Walter
Stowers returned from a visit to Evansville,
Ind., and Cincinnati last Tuesday, Mr Stow
ers goes into rapture over the hospitalities
of the people in that part of the country.
One of the chief events of the season was the
Oak and Iyy social at the residence of Mr and
Mrs Geo Barrier, 432 Branbien street, on
Tuesday evening, Jan 2. The creme de la
creme of Detroit was there, all formality was
thrown aside and the club and its guests were
bent on enjoying themselves. With “music
NEW YORK, SATURDAY, JANUARY 13, 1883.
and with flowers the joyous hours danced
on.” One of the chief amusements was a set
of new beginners, who had never danced be
fore. Their blunders and failures were the
cause of much merriment, in which the par
ticipants took as active a part as the specta
tors. There were checkers, chess, cards and
magic hoops for those who did not dance.
Among the strangers present were Misses
Minerva Edmonds and Anna Washington of
Bay City, Desdy Miller of St Clair, M. Will
iams of Marquette, Virginia Bentley of
Grand Rapids, Prof Boston of Chicago, and
Mr Charles Cottwell of Toledo, Ohio. Other
guests'? and members, Mr and Mrs Geo Bar
rier, Mr and Mrs Jas H. Cole, Mr and Mrs
Geo W. Cheek, Mr and Mrs John B. Ander
son, Mr and Mrs Harris, Mr and Mrs Henry
Copper, Mr and Mrs Wm W. Ferguson, Mrs
Mirault, Mrs Robert Pelham, Mrs L. Tomlin
son, Misses F. Anderson, Julia Bush, P.
Golden, R. Dolton, H. Warner, A. Brooks,
Eva and Lizzie Young, Meta E. Pelham’
Edith Mirault, F. Grant, A. Watson, Susie
and Mary Williams, M. Tomlinson, Estella
and Julia Owens, Messrs C. Williams, D. L.
Watson, V. Hackley, R. Pelham, Jr., B.
Benj Pelham, Wm H. Anderson, O. Miller,
R. Duncan, J. E. Ames, C. Mirault, A. WTil
son, J. Dye, T. Cole and others.
Wednesday evening, Jan 4, a number of
young lads and misses, ranging in age from 4
to 15 years, gave fcr the members of the Oak
and Ivy Cinb, at the re»«ience of Dr S. C.
Watson, a very pleasant entertainment. It
opened with a prologue by Miss Hattie Bar
rier; little Lily Watson’s recitation was very
well received. The tableaux were good, also
the drama. The entertainment closed with
an epilogue by little Maud, and a grand
march in which all of the little band took
part. The young folks had been carefully
trained by Miss Flora B. Grant, who deserves
considerable credit for the care and pains
which she had taken to make the affair a
success.
A reading was given by Mrs M. E. Lam
bert, assisted by three of her pupils, Miss Ida
Wilson, Miss Edith Miiuult and Miss Dora
Williams, at Queen of Sheba Parlor, Jan 4.
Although a very stormy night it was well at
tended, and may be considered as a success.

of republican members of legislature, Sena
tor Ferry received the nomination of senator.
Many members however would not attend and
refuse to support him. On the 16th iast., the
legislature ballot for senator; there will no
doubt be a dead-lock, and prospects of a long
fight are excellent. Waud.

The Waiter’s Union Benevolent Associa
tion gave their seventh entertainment, coffee
party and sociable at Paine Hall, Jan 4. The
concert was an enjoyable affair. Several of our
musical talent and elocutionists participated.
Mr Lewis A. Fisher sang well, Miss Sadie
Wardell was well received, the child violinist
was the star, and her performancee were
heartily encord. After the concert the large
company present proceeded to the upper hail
where the choice edibles furnished by the
efficient committee were partook of. Dancing
was indulged in till the small hours, and
everyone left well pleased with the efforts of
Messrs N. J. Burnes, T. E. Bowser. R. Jones,
T. Munroe, A. B. Allen, J. Allen, H. Jones,
Wm Bland, A. S. Baker, who deserve great
praise for their successful efforts. Mr C. E.
Harris acted as floor manager with an efficient
corps of aids.
‘One of the most important of our social
events occurred last Monday evening at Paine
Memorial Hall under the auspices of the
Fraternal Association of this city, which for
brilliancy and grandeur has never been sur
passed by any like event of the past. The
beautiful ladies, attired in the latest and
fashionable costumes, added tone and digni
ty to the occasion. Space will not permit to
mention the many elegant dresses worn. Suf
fice to say that Worth, with the experience
of his many years, could not have rivalled
the ladies in the make-up of their costumes.
Promptly at 9:30 P. M.the members and their
guests began to assemble and were taken un
der the escort of the efficient reception com
mittee, consisiing of Messrs L. H. Barnes, W.
B. Lee, H. S. Lewis, G. H. Worthington, E.
E. Coleman and W. H. Smith. The Ger
mania orchestra, one of the best of our city,
was stationed on the stage at the head of the
hall, where new and popular airs were dis
coursed. The grand march to supper at
10:45 was led off by Mr George White, who
instituted some new and pleasing movements
in the execution of the same. The members
and their guests took the position assigned to
them in Investigation Hall, where the supper
was served, and was called to order by Chair
man Wm O. Armstrong, who introduced
Chaplain W. H. Smith, who invoked divine
blessing. Tufts, the caterer, furnished an ex
cellent menu, to which ample justice was
done by those seated around the festive board.
After discussing the delicious viands, remarks
were made by several of the officers of the
association. Mr Armstrong introduced Pres
ident Richard N. Gordon, who paid a glowing
tribute to the work performed by the Asso
ciation in 1882. Representative Julius C.
Chappelle submitted his report as treasurer,
and showed the finances of the society to be
in a satisfactory condition. Ex-Secretary B.
J. Janey gave an interesting account of the
proceedings of the Association during the
past year and spoke feelingly on the death of
their worthy and esteemed member, Bernard
C. Davis. Chaplain Smith offered prayer and
then the company adjourned to the upper
hall to indulge in the mazes of the giddy
waltz. The music was superb and we can
satisfactorily assert but few persons present
lost any of the dances w hich were set down
°u i or der. It would be impossible to name
the long list of persons present, but it is safe
to say that the elite of Boston was well repre
sented on the occasion. The visitors present
from some of our large cities were Mrs and
Mr Potter and John Dorris of Worcester
Mias King of Springfield, and Miss S. Tasco
of Lynn, who were royally entertained. Dur
ing the evening Mr U. A. Ridley introduced
his tramp march in the laneiers, which was
well executed by those familiar with it. Car
riages were ordered at 2 a. m. Tuesday
morning and every one left perfectly satisfied
with the results of the 13th Anniversary of
the Fraternal Association.
On Wednesday last, Miss Fannie Washing
ton of Boston died after a lingering illness of
six months. Deceased was a prominent lady
of society and was connected with our musi
cal and literary associations. She was a
soloist at the 12th Baptist church, and was
also one of the quartette who sang at the fu
neral of Hon Chas Sumner. Her funeral,
which occurred on Monday last, at the resi
dence in Smith’s Court, was largely attended
by her friends and acquaintances. Rev L.
G. Walden conducted the ceremonies, which
were solemn and impressive. The remains
which were life-like, were encased in an ele
gant rosewood casket. A large number of rela
tives and friends followed them to Woodlawn
Cemetery, where they were interred. Miss
Washington leaves behind her a large circle
of relatives and friends who truly mourn
their loss.
The party announced for June 17th in our
issue of Dec 30 ult., should have read Jan
17. The affair will occur at the residence of
Mr C. H. Lewis, under the supervision of Je
rome Jeffries, Parker Bailey, W. O. Goodell
and Louis Garbe. It will be of a musical and
literary nature. The Bay State Lodge of Bos
ton, G. U. O. of O. F., will celebrate their
26th anniversary by a concert, supper and
promenade on Monday evening, Jan 15, at
Paine Memorial Hall. Prominent talent has

dered at 2 a. m. Miss Cecilia M. Washington,
formerly of this city, but now a school teach
er in Gould’s Town, N. J., was surprised by
several of her friends at the residence of her
mother at 7 Fruit street court, on Wednesday
evening, Dec 27. Miss Washington left for
her field of labor on December 28. The
celebration of Emancipatron day, Jan 1,
under the auspices of the Rob’t G. Shaw
Veteran Association, was a very fine affair.
The exercises at the Joy street Church were
well conducted, and a large number of specta
tors was present. The flag presented to the
Veterans was very handsome, after which
they made a street parade in company with
Robert A. Bell Post 134, and Co. L., 6th
Regiment.
TheNewYear’s tree of Zion Sunday-school,
on the evening of Jan Ist, attracted a
large number of the scholars and their
friends. No preliminary exercises took place.
The presents were numerous and very hand
some, and all were well satisfied when they
departed at 9:30 p. m. J. D. Powell.
Philadelphia Letter.
Philadelphia, Jan B.—lt is gratifying to
know that one editor is being kindly received
by the public. Your editorial correspond
ence from Boston, your presence at Washing
ton, all indicate that our people are beginning
to appreciate the power and value of the
Press. We have in our city the oldest and
one of the most respected colored journalists
in America, who, to my knowledge, is sel
dom invited or entertained by our citizens.
They have time and again used his columns
for their own elevation, for which they lacked
public spirit enough to compensate him.
The Morris Brown Keystone Literary met
last Thursday evening at 2111 Sharswood
street. The next meeting will be held in
Monumental Hall, corner Poplar and Vine
yard streets. All are invited. Bethel Church,
Rev J. S. Thompson, pastor, at 10:30 a. m.,
Rev Wm H. Harris preached a very interest
ing, instructive and impressive sermon from
I. Cori., 23—24. Afternoon Sunday-school
convened at the usual hour. Quarterly re
view by the Superintendent, interspersed with
singing, which was very interesting. In the
evening before New Year’s watch night ser
vices did not commence till 9 o’clock. From
6 to 8 o’clock was prayer and praise meeting
which was enjoyed very much by the mem
bers of the church and others. The church
was comfortably filled. Watch meeting on
New Year’s Eve at Morris Brown Mission was
largely attended—the largest in the history
of the Mission. The services were opened at
8 o’clock p. M. by singing. Madam Garrison
presided at the organ. After addressing the
throne of grace the pastor gave an exposition
of Luke xv. Eleven o’clock having arrived
the pastor announced his sermon for the oc
casion, theme: “The Barren Fig Tree;”
text, Luke xiii., 6-9. Communion next Sunday
afternoon at 3p. m. The city pastors will
assist, and their congregations are invited
to lend a helping hand. At Cherry-st Bap
tist Church there was at good attendance at
the morning services and at the watch-night
service an immense audience. The pastor,
Rev T. Doughty Miller, officiated at both ser
vices. Singing of the choir was a marked
feature of the evening service, though the
masterly sermon on “ Light out of Darkness,
or Lessons from the Grave Robbery,” of some
time ago was heard by an immense audience.
There is still a demand for its repetition in
some hall, where the entire colored communi
ty can hear the good argument in defense of
universal manhood. A presentation came off
in the vestry of Allen Chapel on New Year’s
night consisting of a handsome heavy gold
headed ebony cane, the gift of Messrs Aaron
Orrick, O. Brown, Daniel S. Matthews and I.
J. F. Handy, to their pastor, Rev C. T. Schaf
fer, which was followed by the presentation
of a fine portrait of Mr Schaffer in a heavy
gilt frame, gotten up by Miss J. Cornell and
Mrs L. Bruce. On Wednesday evening a
heavy water pitcher, waiter and goblet, beau
tifully carved, were presented to the pastor’s
wife, Mrs A. M. Schaffer, whose name was
carved on each piece.
The ladies connected with Wesley A. M.
E. Zion Church, gave a grand New Year’s
entertainment on Thursday evening at the
church. M. B. Brown gave an organ volun
tary, followed by a chorus from the choir; P.
Cooper, director.
The gentlemen connected with the cornet
club gave a very fine oyster supper and recep
tion to their lady friends at their rooms, Nos
1008 and 1010 Rodman street, on New Year’s
evening. The tables were ladened down with
all the delicacies of the season, aud the rooms
were handsomely decorated with the flags of
all nations, and fine oil paintings. The toi
lets of the ladies were superb. The associa
tion will accept thanks for considerations.
The following constituted the official staff:
Charles Davis, president; Stephen Frisby
treasurer; W. Harris, secretary; J. Riley’
assistant secretary; William Howard, mar
shal; Geo H. Beckett, chairman. The Han
nibal held its meeting Thursday evening, the
4th inst., and it was one of unusual interest.
Important points in connection with the suc
cess of literary associations were discussed.
All lovers of music were gratified on hearing
the Hannibal choir, under the skillful guid
ance of their leader, Traffagar Holmes. Mr
Willie, as organist, impresses every listener
with his artistic performance. After the mu
sical prologue, the debate continued, “Re
solved, that the mental capacities of both
sexes are equal.” Excellent points on both
sides of the question were produced, and elic
ited hearty applause from the audience. The
debate will be continued, and on Wednesday
week, Messrs Polk, Calles, Tupumes and J.
L. Jenkins will contest the subject. The
Rev Wm Schaffer will deliver a lecture before
the association in February. In March they
will give a grand reception for which they are
making great preparations. An original dra
ma, written by their critic, J. L. Jenkins,
entitled ‘The Colored Soldiers in the Rebel
lion,” with a favorite military organization
in the cast, will be produced.
Sunday, Dec 31, 1882, the obsequies of Jas
M. Randolph, chorister of the Union A. M.
E. Church, and musical director of the school
took place. The pastor, Rev John W. Beck
ett, delivered a very fine, able and appropri
ate discourse on the life and death of the de
ceased. The choir, the Apollo musical as
sociation and the Sunday school rendered
suitable music in fine style. The floral tri
bute were very fine and handsome. Two
similar harps of roses, embroidered in wreaths
upon which tops in a hovering position were
perched two white doves, given by the school
and choir. Across his seat in the choir, was
thrown a black scarf. The banners of the
school were draped in black, and as the fun
eral cortege took up its line of march, Joseph
TI. Gardner and Burton R. Young were in
the lead, each bearing in his arms the two
principal floral offerings. Pall-bearers: Sam
uel J. Di ton, W. J. Truett, W. I. Powell and
Jeremiah Young. Members of the associa
tion, officers of the school and choir, paid
their last tribute of respect to the deceased
by seeing his remains properly interred in the
Olive Cemetery.
New Year’s day proved a very pleasant
one for those who received, and those who
called. The young men’s social club gave a
grand masquerade to their lady friends at
1705 Vine street, on New Year’s evening.
There were present Geo Soloman, Y’ork High
gate, Mr and Mrs Lipson, Mr rnd Mrs Burns,
Mr and Mrs Williams, Mr and Mrs Rhodes,
