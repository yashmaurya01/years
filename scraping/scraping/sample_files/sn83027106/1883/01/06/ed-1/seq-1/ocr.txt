Philadelphia Letter.
Philadelphia, Dec 31, 1882.—Since my
last letter the Christmas holidays have stolen
rapidly upon us bringing with them a series
of delightful gatherings which have given
Philadephians a great deal of pleasure with
little or no dissipation. The season is not
being devoted to that wild and exhausting
pleasure seeking which has marked it in years
that have passed. But has introduced to the
people a new source of enjoyment in music.
We have attended entertainments where the
redeeming feature has been a solo from
Madam Selika, from Mrs Nellie Brown Mitch
ell, or from some lesser light. But not in
the memory of the eldest inhabitant has there
ever been given in this city an entertain
ment so thoroughly complete in every de
tail and so grand a musical success, as that
given on the evening of Wednesday, Decem
ber 27, at Musical Fund Hall by theAmphion
Sing'ng Society. This organization had its
birth in October, ’Bl. Eight gentlemen band
ed under the above name. Some attention
was given to the details of organization, but
most efforts were directed toward securing the
best musical arrangement with the very small
quantity of material. Between this and the
closing rehearsal which took place at Tem
perance Hall on Tuesday evening, May 30,
’B2, the membership was increased to eigh
teen, and it now numbers twenty-three, the
society as now constituted having had but
three months practice. That the choruses
were well rendered is a fact beyond dispute,
and is very complimentary to the rhusical di
rector, Mr C. Samuel Adger, and the mem
bers, when we remember the extreme youth
of the organization, and that the gentlemen
are not professional musicians.
The first number on the program was “The
Chapel,” by-Kreutzer, a very fine selection,
was well rendered. The attention given to
the time and expression added so much to it
that it was thought by many to be one of the
gems of the evening. The next chorus,
“Bell Song,” is a much more difficult compo
sition, and though very finely sung the audi
ence did not demand an encore, This appar
ent indifference had a very bad effect on the
gentlemen, for when they reached “Old Folks
at Home,” they labored as Jf a chill had
struck them, and seemed aJious to avail
themselves of the few minuW « intermission
which immediately followed, f Ke second part
was introduced by that magnificent chorus
“Sam Martino” by Dodson. : Here the mem
bers seemed to regain t’ Mr I confidence, and
some very beautiful woj k Was ddie. They
deserved the very heart f ericore which was
given. This was follci. ’d toy “The Sabbath
Call,” another very beautifufl arrangement of
harmony. But its “lidarity,” by Dehn, that
provided the opportunity; for the infant
daughter of one of our worthy citizens to
startle the audience with A purely childlike
laugh, accompanied with tine remark, “Oh!
’tis too funny.” So it was jquite funny, and
was the selection that required a very rapid
movement. This was encoded and repeated,
and again encored. The program was finish
ed with the two very choice selections “Love
ly Night,” by Chwatal, and “Good Night,”
by C. Samuel Adger. In (the study and sing
ing of these selections, tlye society has display
ed ability far above th^a; erage, and has tak

startled by a very brilliant light in Adelaide

men. Though a stranger to us, (has proba
bly favored a New York audience, if she has
not, give her the opportunity and I can assure
you, you will not regret it). When she ap
peared she was very heartily ret eived. During
the singing of her first selection, “Una Voce
Poco Pa,” the audience sat so quietly that
every note could be eas ; ’y Heard in all parts
of the hall. From the very first notes the
audience seemed to feel that they were going
to be treated to some exceptional singing and
so it proved. The lady appeared to lose sight
of her audience and entered so thoroughly in
to the spirit of her selection, that she soon
displayed a perfect knowledge of the require
ments of the music, a rich, round, sweet
voice, and evidence of careful study and

who will undoubtedly have a following when
ever she may appear in our city. Mr J. H.
Clifton’s solo—“To be near thee,” shows a
decided improvement since his first appearance
with the Amphion. He has shown great wis
dom in remaining with them. He should
avail himself of every weekly rehearsal. Miss
es Cassey and Gilbert who are so well known
in the musical world contributed largelv to
the program. The ladies played brilliantly
and deserved the encores which they received.
They both give evidence of continued study
and practice. MrF. J. R. Jones’ violin solo was
a feature of the entertainment. His selection
the “Sixth Air Varied,” was treated in a
masterly and finished manner.
Interesting services were held at Wesley A.
M. E. Church last Sabbath. The pastor,
Rev M. H. Ross, preached in the morning
and evening to large audiences. The choir
furnished appropriate music. The church
was beautifully trimmed with evergreens, the
galleries were festooned and a beautiful cross
was in front of the pulpit. The rector an
ounced a watch-meeting service for New
Year’s Eve, commencing at 8:30 o’clock with
a hymn service by the choir. Preaching at
9 o clock,j followed by a praise meeting until
12. This church has recently been remodled
and repaired; the vestry is working hard with
their pastor to complete the work before con
ference which meets here in the spring. The
ladies of the church are making arrangements
to furnish new seats for the vestry and will
hold a musical entertainment and japanese.

The annual concert of the Young People’s
Musical and Literary Society of the Crucifix

two Most Worshipful Grand Lodges of col

ferred up the following prayer. “In the
name of God, amen, amen; to thee we offer
thanks in the name of the craft of Free and
Accepted Masons (colored) of the state of
Pennsylvania, peace, happiness and prosper

Where, there exists in the state of Pennsyl
vania two separate bodies known as Grand
Lodges of colored Free Masons the same hav
ing existed for a long period of time and by
said separation the social happiness of the
members of both grand lodges has been great
ly retarded. Whereas, the principles of our
time-honored institution demand no such
separation. Therefore be it resolved: both
parties agreeing that we enter into ways and
means to effect a lasting union of the craft in
the state of Pennsylvania on the following
basis, that after St John's dav, December 27,
A. D., 1882, there shall be all but one Grand
Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons in the
state of Pennsylvania.

Boston, Dec 3.—Christmas week has been
made joicous by eventswhich have gladdened
the hearts of the lovers of amusements. Wed
dings and private parties have been the
order of the day. We were called upon to
report the marriage of Mrs Mary Brothers
to Chas Dunsett, for many years coachman
to Mr Jordan, of the firm of Jordan, Marsh
& Co. The marriage ceremony occurred at
the residence of Mr Hetrick, on Wednesday
evening, December 27, at 8 p. m., after which
a reception was held at the residence of

Miss Estelle Pinckney opened by rendering
a piano solo. Mr John Ransom’s singing

showed marked improvement and astonished
her auditors; Mr Fred White accompanist, as
usual, was good. After the concert Lieut
James Trotter stepped on the platform and
in a few chosen words presented to the audi
ence the editor of The Globe. Mr Fortune’s
remarks were well timed and to the point,
and entertained some wholesome advice re
ative to the situation of our race. He was
listened to attentively and hisj effort were
highly appreciated. The success of the affair
is mainly due to the efficient committee
who managed the affair.

THE SEA ISLAND NEGIIOES.
A Tribute to the Worth of Some of
Their Early Friends.
To The Editor of the Glore. I have
just read “ The Southern Problem—Material
Progress of the Sea Island Negroes,” in your,
issue of Dee 23d, credited to the New York
Sun. Having some acquaintance with the Sea
Islands, and, if 1 mistake not met there the
author of that communication, 1 am of course
much interested in it.
From my observations in the south I have
long deemed St Helena’s the earthly paradise
of the freedmen, andean confirm his descrip
tion of its prosperity up to the time of my
visit there in 1877. But when he closes by
saying: “ This is a truthful story of the
material progress these people have made on
an island where they have not had the so-call
ed benefits of association with the superior
while race,” a thought and a fact or two
should be added. Is it intended to imply
that a people so degraded as has just been
described has made such progress unaided
—spontaneously? If so why trouble one’s
self about civilizing Africa ? or any mission
werk? 1 ao not dispute, but only continue
the statements made, to correct possible mis
apprehension. March 4th, 1877, I plucked a
flower from a grave near the “ big church ”
hard by the. over-crowded school-rooms of
Frogmore, and reading upon the leaning head
stone the name of Elizabeth Gladden, almost
I seemed to see her face smiling down from
the blue depths above; for I had just wit
nessed a scene that would have gladdened her
heart, not less than her mission, begun
there almost before the cannon’s roar had
ceased from Hilton’s Head, and gladdened the
newly emancipated. Though the malaria
soon made her this lowly bed, another noble
women did not hesitate to take up the work
which had fallen from her death-chilled
hands; and Miss Laura Town became the
judicious friend, teacher, doctor, legal ad
viser. and I may almost say, th» mother of
the islanders, devoting her time and ample
talents and means to their interests. She per
sonally taught and supported a large school,
paying an assistant; and as clerk she was
really the “ Board” for the thirteen schools
upon the island; the one colored member be
ing unlettered, and the one white male mem
ber too indifferent to do more than give their
needed signatures to her propositions.
She studied medicine for the purpose, and
administered to their milder diseases, nursed
and taught them how to , nurse in the sick
room, and advised when to call a physician.
She informed herself regarding the laws, and
advised then of legal rights, counselling for
peaceable settlements whenever possible.
She urged the planting of trees and shrubs
around their houses, to cultivate the home
sentiment, —one of the most difficult lessons
for them to learn; she taught neatness, econ
omy, and thrift; and fortnightly met the
mothers and larger girls at. her house, and cut
and taught them to cut and make the cloth
ing for their families. This entire work she
had continued many years. Three devoted
young ladies from the north were her assis
tants, two of them conducting each an inde-

whom she had educated at Frogmore, taught
each a school—completing the thirteen.
I never envied any woman as I envied her;'
the implicit confidence and love I saw mani

must have felt in looking over the dusky
audience she had called together, and that
crowded the old church on that “‘Temperance
day” of all the schools. Even at this remote
day I seem to see the eager, smiling faces;
the sweet perfume of the vellow jasmine upon
the dark foreheads of the girls salutes *my
sense, and the sound of the soul-stirring

crowded galleries, rolls through the open
windows and shakes the periwinkles glisten

Troy Letter.
Troy, Jan 3.— It is apparent that the cus
tom of elaboiately entertaining New Year’s
callers is fast dying in our city, and as a conse
quence that day was not as lively as it might
have been. I can but refer to the last call ot
the “Jolly five” consisting of Sam’l W. Gib
son, LL. 8., Hon F. A. Chew, Prof A. Azien, J.
M. Kemp A. M., and your correspondent, rhe
call was made at the residence of Mr J. H.
Schuyler, where we were entertained by the
Misses Schuyler, Miss Jennie Anthony and Miss
Carrie Peterson. Everything was made so
pleasant tor the “ tramps ” that they forgot
themselves and their " call” was prolonged in
to a ‘‘visit.” Two o’clock, a. m., tqund us
speeding on our way homeward. KeV W. C.

specting the obstacle found it to be a “ Mrs
Langtry ” bonnet, supposed to have been lost
in the immense crowd which extended nearly
a block on each side of tne church. The Kev

hat and taking it to church with him. From
here it was taken to his home pro tern, the resi
