NEW YORK. SATURDAY. JANUARY 6, 1883.
Colored men of New York, behold Bill
Freeman and his iron-clad Republican Col
ored County Committee accepting an office
from the democratic sheriff of New York
County, as a reward for the “ manly inde
pendence” displayed by the colored voters at
the November election. We thank Sheriff
Davidson for the appointment of a colored
deputy sheriff (and for the three keg§ of lager
beer to wash the appointment down the
throats of the obsequious committee); but
how Mr Davidson came to find any “ inde
pendence ” in the jumping-jack chairman
and the knuckle-close members of his stalwart
County Committee may puzzle some of our
readers, but we are not surprised. We were
not ignorant of the fact that Bill Freeman
had struck a bargain with the democratic
.managers while the late canvass was in pro
gress, and that was one of the reasons why
we spewed him out as so much putrefaction.
During the late election we acted squarely on
the merits of the candidates—we opposed the
fraudulent republican candidates, but we did
not strike hands with the democracy for a
crumb of office or money; but Bill Fbeb
man (who said we had done so) shows, when
4the smoke of battle has passed away, that he
is the black Judas, not The Globe editor.
Who screamed louder for the dirty republi
can candidates in the November election
than Bill Freeman and his committee?
Who now takes democratic office with more
'dinking alacrity than they? Away with you,
you treacherous Benedict Arnolds of the
black voters of New York! If the colored
voters of New York continue to permit them
selves to be bought and sold by such a man
as Freeman has shown himself to be they de
serve to be the butt of ridicule and contempt.
They should spew the vile hypocrite out of
their mouths; let them show that they are
honest, manly men. Behold Bill Freeman
— a democratic, office for a member of his
knuckle-close committee! Behold the mask
torn from the contortioned visage of the rep
resentative Negro of New York! Colored men
of New York, gaze upon the straw-man of
your generous, your affectionate creation.
Hon Perry Belmont was tendered the
honor of a public dinner at Delmonico’s list
■week, and a great deal of Democratic senti
ment found its way into the newspapers.
From what we could discover, however,
nothing was said that has not been said just
as appropriately before. Mr Belmont does
not look with favor on the proposal to en
large the efficiency of the federal courts,
but thinks that it would be better for the
next democratic congress to thoroughly in
' vestigate the present condition of the federal
’Courts, with a view to ascertaining “whether
or not such legislation, which has so increased
the jurisdiction and work of the federal
courts to the disparagement of the courts of
the several states, cannot be repealed.” It
is just here that the democratic party is
likely to “slip up.” A great deal of the
legislation which has enlarged the scope of
the federal judiciary is dangerous and a
great deal of it is essential to a pro per interpre
tation of the rig its of the United States and
of the several states, and when the demo
jcratic party commences to descriminate, if it
is not very careful, it will descriminate itself
out of power. The ground is dangerous.
The unanimity with which the senate pass
ed the civil service bill commends itself to the
people of the country, who unconditionally
demand the correction of evils and abuses
’which have found their way into the service.
The provision in the bill which provides that
persons given to excessive drink shall not be
employed in the service is a very wise one,
and will be productive of much good. The
fixture of tenure provision is not so commen
dable. It may work mischief in the long run.
But on the whole the bill as passed by the
senate will pass muster, and the unanimity
with which it passed that body shows that the
legislators of the people are not unmindful of
the popular voice when it is aroused and
makes its commands in the proper spirit.
R. Henri Herbert has sold the Trenton
Sentinel to T. F. Fitzgerald, the Trenton
correspondent of the New York Herald, and
Andrew M. Clarke the local editor of the
Trenton State Gazette. It will be issued next
Sunday as a first class Sunday paper. It is
understood that Mr. Herbert will retain an
interest in the paper under the new manage
ment.

Valuable and useful present to us.
BOSTON AND ITS PEOPLE.
Impressions Gleaned by the Editor of
The Globe.
Boston, Dec 30. —Boston and Massachu
setts are synonymous terms, regarded in the
light of .their people—their liberal sentiment,
their pleasing and cultured manners, and
their generous efforts to make a stranger at
home with them and theirs. True, they are
much like an oyster, with his mouth shut,
until they know something of you, but when
they have weighed you, if not found wanting,
they take you to their warm breasts, just as
if you were home-folks. This is true of all
clt^KS and sects, but much truer of the Bos
who is the embodiment of intelli
^^^^^Limiability. These latter are excel
fl^^W^rersationalists and accomplished
musical adepts—playing artistically and sing
ing like mocking birds. I have ample reason
to know and appreciate these facts, for I was
the guest of the good people of Boston from
Thursday morning to Saturday evening of
last week. On the Fall River steamer from
New York to Newport I enjoyed the conge
nial society of Mr and Mrs Geo T. Downing.
Wendell Phillips
At the head of Common street, in a small
brick house, upon the door of which there is
no plate to tell who lives within, Mr Geo T.
Downing and myself found Mr Wendell
Phillips, than whom no man contributed
more to the formatian of that public senti
ment which eliminated from our system of
government the virus of slavery. Mr Phil
lips has grown old in good works, and, as he
himself said, the circle of those who once
labored with him, grows constantly smaller
as the years roll by. But that eagle eye,
those heavy brows, that Roman nose, and
that silver tongue are as pristine as in the
long ago when howling mobs quailed beneath
their fiery rage, indignation and awful denun
ciation. He is one of the most perfect de
velopments of our institutions—broad cul
ture, masterly eloquence, expansive sympa
thy and full of Christian benevolence. Mas
sachusetts, more than any other state in the
Union, has given us many men of lise type, and
the tolerant atmosphere of that state is emi
nently adapted to the development of such
noble men. What a grand country would be
ours if we had thirty-eight, instead of one
Massachusetts, in the Union! Mr Phillips
has but recently moved into tbnumon street,
and he certainly does not feel at home there.
He spoke feelingly of his old home, where
he had lived, labored and loved for forty
years, and from which he was forced by that
onward march of “improvement,” the mod
ern craze, which neither regards the feelings
of men nor those historical landmarks
I which should be the pride and gio
ry of our large cities. Mr Phillips
has disposed of his valuable collection of
anti-slavery papers "and pamphlets to differ
ent libraries in Boston, New York and Phila
delphia, so that they may be preserved to pos
terity and consulted by’ the inquisitive. In
speaking of this disposition of his collection it
struck me that Mr Phillips did so with a cer
tain degree of sadness—as indicative of a
change in his life which contained more of
bitter than of pleasant reflection.
Mr Phillips Treated as a Black Man.
Among the reminiscences which Mr
Phillips recounted to us, the. following
one, in which he was treated, for the
first and last time, as a colored man,
seemed to amuse him most. In 1862, while
passing through New York City, he
stepped into a hotel and registered his
name, remarking to the clerk that he
would step out a moment (to get a
paper, he thought), and would not chose his
room until he came back, and handed the
clerk his satchel. When he returned, and
asked to be allowed to select h’3 room, the
proprietor, who had come in during his
absence, handed him his satchel and said:
“We have no vacant rooms.” “Do you
mean that, or do you mean you do not de
sire to accommodate Wendell Phillips?”
asked Mr. Phillips. “I mean Ido not care
to accommodate you, sir,” And the great
good man took his satchel and walked into
the streets of New York, feeling how deep
was that hatred of the helpless and defense
less slave which could vent its spleen and
littleness upon him who had always fought
manfully for the right, through evil report
as well as good. Mr Phillips expressed un
bounded satisfaction at the marvellous pro
gress which our race has made since the war.
They have, in his estimation, done even
more than he anticipated of them. He does
not believe in colored churches and schools,
but thinks all the people should live in har
mony together, each taking and enjoying his
proper share of the common benefits of go
vernment and society without any other than
those restrictions which society always has
and always will evolve from its inner con
sciousness for self-protection. He thought
we had a promising future before us, and
thought that honest difference of'opinion
among thoughtful colored men which obtains
at this time was an encouraging and healthy
sign of intellectual vigor and a more settled
condition. Mrs Phillips is in very poor
health, and Mr Phillips himself is not as
vigorous as could be desired.
Death of Robert Morris. Jr.
One of the most imposing funerals I ever wit
nessed was that of Robert Morris, Jr, son of
Robert Morris (who was buried two weeks
before,) at the church of the Immaculate Con
ception, Friday morning, December 29. A
striking feature of the funeral was the con
spicuous absence of the colored element, for
p the vast congregation of two thousand or
more there coidd not have been more than four
THE NEW YORK GLOBE: SATURDAY, JANUARY 6. 1883.
hundred persons of his own race. Of the
twelve pall bearers there was not one colored
man, and of all places of honor in the funera^
procession there was not one assigned to a
colored family, or man, or woman. Mrsr
Morris leaned upon the slender arm of a
young white man, who was a law clerk of th#’
Morris law firm, while the brother and fami
ly of Robert Morris, Sr., were disposed of
as distant acquaintances, rather than near and
dear relatives, of the deceased. I never be
fore saw so much honor paid to the memory
of a colored man by white people and less
paid to the memory of a colored man by col
ored people. This singular state of things,
this phenomenal way of conducting a color
ed funeral, I doubt not, will be news of a
conflicting nature to that numerous class of
readers of The Globe who do not dwell un
der the historical inspiration of Bunker Hilj
and the Old South Church. The Catholic
priest who officiated at the funeral threw out
a remark which may edify the meanness and
narrowness which sway the policy of the av
erage Protestant Church of the land—that
Protestant Church which loves God so veftv
much and the common brotherhood of man
kind so very little. The priest said in sub
stance, and truly, that the Catholic Church
was uuiversal in its consistency of the Father
hood of God and the brotherhood of man—
that the Catholic Church was large enough to
contain people of all races, and catholic enough
to treat them, one and all, alike. Let the nar
row-minded, the lying Methodist minister,
who lately declared, in a GoD-forsaken village
in Alabama, that colored people “were not
invited, and not expected to attend, his
church,” put the remarks of the Boston priest
in his pipe and smoke them, and let others
of like ilk do the same thing. If the hypo
critical Protestant churches would hate the
Catholic Church less and practice its compre
hension and love of mankind as taught in the
Bible more, some people would have more Te
speet for Protestant principles and less con
tempt for Protestant hypocrisy and meanness.
And lam one of this latter class. I don’t be
lieve in much that the Catholic Church teach
es, but I do believe that a man can go as di
rectly to heaven through a Catholic gate as
he can through a Methodist one, especially
when we have such a Methodist gate as J the
Alabama preacher has been pleased to define.
Some Boston Editors.
The editors of Boston are an honor to the
fraternity, as far as I could judge, and very
justly rank With those of New York and Phil
adelphia. Xlr Holmes, chief of staff of
the Boston Herald, is a man of broad culture
and liberal nature, with a countenance as
mild and benevolent as that possessed by Col
McClure of the Philadelphia Times. He
weighs his remarks and speaks with delitoa
tion? Tile editor'oT* vv^lTattscript is^man^
of thoughtful countenance, with compressed
lips, which indicate strong resolution, while
his meditatives eyes and heavy brows indi
cate reflection and, perhaps, much sarcasm
and acrimony in dealing with a subject. He
appears to draw much inspiration from a fine
ly colored meershaum. Mr Worthington,
editor of the Boston Traveler and collector of
customs, is a veteran journalist and thorough
ly in sympathy with the work. He was pro
lific of reminiscences of journalism, and looked
with pleasure upon the importance and influ
ence to which newspaper literature had
grown. Forty years ago, when he com
menced the Weekly Traveler, a circulation of
2,000 was considered a great thing. But
times have changed, and the daily circulation
of the Traveler has grown to be upwards of
100,000. Will colored journalism ever attain
to this? I am not without hope, I am not
without encouragement, that it will. Such a
transformation can only be effected by the
years and the labor of the future—many years,
much labor. Col Slack, editor of the Com
monwealth and collector of Internal Revenue,
is a political wheel-horse. *and a gentleman
who has many kind words at his command.
We found him lo be a very pleasant gentle
man.
Messrs. T. A. Ridley and J. H. Lewis
do each a paying tailoring business and are
among the solid men of Boston. Mr Ridley
is a gentleman who knows how to make a
dollar and turn it to the best account. He
owns a fine residence on Buckingham street,
and his home is made happy by an accom
plished wife and sister and by the sunny
smile of a sweet little daughter. Mr Ridley
drives a fast team, and Mr Lewis has three
fine specimens of horse flesh in his stables.
Mr Geo L. Ruffin and E. W. Walker each
have a lucrative law practice and enjoy the
respect and confidence of the good people of
Boston. They have each served in the legisla
ture of Massachusetts. Mr Wm H. Dupree
is superintendent of station “A,” the largest
sub-postoffice in Boston, while Mr James M.
Trotter is second in charge ol the registra
tion department of the main post office.
These two gentlemen are among the most
public-spirited and genial of the colored men
of Boston, and are foremost in every good
cause. Rey J. T. Jenifer, pastor of the
Charles-street A. M. E. Church, is held in
the highest esteem for his learning and piety.
I had not the pleasure of meeting the other
pastors, save an excellent pastor of a Baptist
Church whose name Ido not recall. In the
post office I found Messrs Wm O. Goodell,
Timothy Tines and J. D. Powell, jr., at dis
tributing cases, and Mr Downing in the for
eign department, all young men; while at the
custom house I found Mr Mitchell and Mr
Mullen. At the State House I found Mr J.
W. Wolfe, who is an attorney at law, Mr J. J.
Smith and Mr Lewis Haden, who is now an old
man, knows all the ins and outs of the State
House, and can put his hand upon the oldest
and most historical documents in the posses
sion of the commonwealth without a moment’s
hesitation. Mr Haden is a stalwart republi
can and looks with distrust upon any course
that deflects in the least from the “ good old
way.” Miss Sadie Wardell and Mr John F.
Ranson have excellent soprano and baritone
voices, while Miss Stella Pinckney of Wor
cester, and Mr Fred P. White manipulate
the piano with ease and artistic finish.
Madam Nellie Brown Mitchell,
whose magnificent vocal accomplishments
have so often and in so many places delighted
lovers of good music, has lose none of her
richness of voice and amiability. Married
life has mellowed her vocal powers and lent
a charm and attractiveness to her naturally
sociable disposition. Her husband is a fine
gentleman, and, from what I could see, one
of the autocrats of the custom house, where
he has held a position of honor and trust for
many years. While on a visit to Madam’s
beautiful home on Wellington street Friday
afternoon, I was favored with some classical
selections which were rendered as only Madam
can render them. The atmosphere of
Madam’s home is one of classical music, and
the lady of the home is its life and joy.
Boston has many noble ladies and accom
plished vocalists, and perhaps it is to this
cause is due the large number of her pro
minent men, of which latter she appears to
enjoy a happy number. Mesdames Geo L.
Ruffin, James M. Trotter, Wm H. Dupree,
J. C. Chappille, T. A. Ridley, and ladies of
th# Downing family—Mrs De Mortie, of
Virginia, now in Boston, and Mrs. Wash
ington, with two single daughters—and
Mesdames, S. R. Riley, and J. D. Pow
ell, Jr., whose husbands are earnest
workers of Thh Globe, were among some of
the married ladies who impressed me with
their charming sociability and cultured man
ners. Young misses who would make homes
happy abound in profusive abundance.
Pleasant Remembrances.
My visit to Boston was fruitful of many
pleasant incidents and the formation of some
friendships which I trust may have long and
pleasant duration. The people with whom I
came in contact made me feel as much at home
as I feel in New York. The moral and intel
lectual tone of society is of the most healthy
nature, incomparably in advance of that
which obtains in New York, more vigorous
than that of Philadelphia and more healthy
than that of Washington, to which latter
place I go Monday morning, and will con
tinue my editorial correspondence in this
present issue. Mr J. D. Powell, jr., Boston
correspondent and agent of The Globe, is
untiring in his zeal in our interest and ap
pears to “take” with the good people of
TfSsfonV“ Mr Howard L.~SMiTHoPth’e Boston '
Leader and attache of the reportorial staff of
the Boston Evening Star has my thanks for
friendly attentions and my regrets that his
health is poor; while to Messrs. James M.
Trotter, Wm H. Dupree, Wm O. Goodell,
Hon Julius C. Chappelle and others of the
committee who invited me to Boston, I re
turn many thanks for courtesies and atten
tions which none others know better how to
extend than they. Mr Chappelle and Mr
Gloven were passengers with me by the Nor

early hour. T. T. F.
THE DOUGLASS BANQUET.
Spirit of the Gathering.
Editorial Correspondence.
Washington, Jan 2.—There is something in
the atmosphere of Washington which always
exercises a depressing and often a nauseating
influence upon me. Whether this feeling out
grows from the narrow partisan anthems which
echo on the air, or whether the eternal discus
sion of politics turns a visitor into a political
cynic, I am not prepared to say; but the
grand city, with its culture, its sleepless anx
iety, its barter in offices—the city of Washing
ton is not what it once was to me. It contains
many people I honor and respect, a few who
are friends indeed, and a host for whose short
comings, while condemning, I yet feel a gener
ous spirit of toleration, knowing full well that
the majority of mankind must always be
covered over with the mantle of charity. But
the Douglass Banquet, a spontaneous tribute
of love, respect, honor and veneration, bridged
over many a sigh and stifled many an ex
clamation of indignation and pity. Indeed,
the Douglass banquet was an event in the his
tory of the race. The venerable guest, full of
years and great with honors, bent low his
majestic head of snowy whiteness and re
ceived with pleasurable emotions the homage
of a host of men of his race, the majority of
whom were unborn or in their infancy when
he was thundering against the iniquity of the
slave power and the manifold wrongs of his
own race. Around the festive board were
assembled the flower of youth and the mellow
fruitage of old age—mature age and tender
youth—full of zeal in the cause of the race
and full of gratitude and love for him who had
labored so long and loved them so well. The
sun which had traveled the world across
flooded the horizon with resplendent bright
ness, while the worshippers on mountain and
in valley hailed its power and greatness in
language thrilled with the magic of veneration.
Mr Douglass had lived to see the full harvest
of bis early labors; the harvest was great
and his gratification was no less great.
Hon B. K. Bruce,
who did the honors of the august occasion
was eloquent and earnest in his remarks of
welcome to the honored guest. The follow
ing is a full report of Mr Bruce’g remarks:
Gentlemen: We are here to do honor to
our guest and distinguished fellow-citizen, Hon Fred
erick Douglass, and I submit a few reflections suggested
by the occasion. Our guest possesses qualities of mind
and heart which would have made him a mu. Jed man
in any community and brought him distinction in any
career which he might have selected. The recognition
given him to-night, while conceding to him the posses
sion of great abilities, does not primarily or principally
proceed upon this concession, but upon the further and
honorable fact that he consecrated bls great powers to
the emancipation and elevation of his race.
The great philanthropic movement which enlisted his
sympathies and f urnished occasion for the exercise of
bis powers had its inception nearly a century ago In a
profound conviction of the unrighteousness and barbar
ity of human slavery. The history of American eman
cipation exhibits the same general characteristics tha 1
have distinguished all great endeavors for the amellor
atlon and improvement of the condition of mankind
First, the abstract conception of an existing wrong and
the recognition of the obligation to correct it; next’
the creation of a popular sentiment, in harmony with
the conception of duty and adequate, in itsmalntenance,
to the evils recognized and proposed to be removed;
and then concrete action, the expression in law and ad
ministration of the regulative opinions of the people.
The labors of Frederick Douglass, for the greater
portion of his life, were directed to the accomplishment
of his grand mission when the dreary road he so heroic
ally travelled was lighted for him by the subllmist faith.
For more than a generation his eloquent utterances
w ere directed to quickening the public conscience and
forming the public judgment in the direction of justice
and fair dealing toward an oppressed people.
The apestle of liberty and human progress, he has
lived to behold not only the successful consummation
of his work, but survives, to give the people for whom
he has achieved so much, the advantage of wise counsel
on their entrance upon the new and better era of their
history. The divine Teacher hath declared that “A
man’s life doth not consist in the abundance of the
things which he possesses; that its dignity is in the per
sonal, not the relative, qualities that make it: that its
value and honor are to be sought and found in what it
is, rattier than what it has, in its character rather than
in its surroundings. The logical sequence of these pre
mises is, that development comes from within and not
from without, and that-no people, however much they
may have been stimulated and aided by exterior auxil
iaries, ever achieved an honorable progress except
largely through the representative men produced by
them and within them; and 1 may add also that no suc
cess achieved by a race was ever long maintained when
it ceased to recognize its representative leaders. As a
historical fact, marking the progress of a people, the
remarkable men who arise in the different eras of its
development are produced in groups, not in a series, the
one succeeding the other as the links connect and com
plete the chain.
In some respects it may be said that our guest is an
exception to this historical rule. While receiving the
sympathy and aid of many co-laborers of his own race
and many noble spirits not of his people he, in an im
portant sense, by his very eminence, was isolated from
his fellows, and had no contemporaries in the most crit
ical period of his philanthropic career. In the dignity
of the great purpose that has controlled him, in the
magnitude of the work accomplished, in the resolute
prosecution of his mission, in the steady maintenance
I of his integrity and the retention of public confldence,
through all the years of storm and conflict, we behold
the element of a great character aud the evidences of a
grand career. .
He possesses, as the heir of humanity, the measure of
intirniatles that come to the lot of the humblest and the
wisest alike; but in his relations to his great work and
in his actions in its behalf, it may be said in a very im
portant sense, he made no mistakes, and, in retrospect
ing the past he will lind no occasion for either revision
or modiiicatlon of his action.
I content myself with a Anal thought. The man who
will serve one of his fellows must serve all. The efforts
for one community honestly put forth must contem
plate the fostering of all virtue, and even if the
effort be specific for right doing in one direction the
tendency of this henest, earnest purpose is to carry us
forward in the direction of all well doing. Frederick
Douglass found his own people the subject of oppres
sion, the object of specific wrongs, and his love for
humanity gave first occasion for practical exercise in
this distressful condition of his race and its first ex
pression in an effort to redeem them from their wrongs.
In the accomplishment of this work he wrought not
only that for which he specifically labored, but, from
the very constitution of society, he currently helped all
the races aud all the people of this republic.
To-day, because he has lived and labored, the world
has a higher estimate of the strength and beneficence
of free institutions, and a broader and firmer faith in
the capabilities and future of our common humanity.
Mi Bruce then introduced
The Guest of the Evening,
pleausure to make a few remarks; but he had
never been good at speech-making —after
dinner. Nature had done nothing for him
in that respect. He said he had never made
a short speech with which he had been satis
fied —nor a long one with which anyone else
had been satisfied. [Laughter]. He was glad
to see Mr Bruce in tne presiding chair. He
had differed with many but in the language
of the martyred president, “ with charity to
wards all, with malice towards none.” His life
had been more of cloud than sunshine, more
of storm than ofcalm. “ This occasion is the
Twentieth anniversary of the Emancipation
Proclamation] (a tribute was paid to him
who had issued it); slavery was the sum of
all villianies. Until this day we had no fu
ture; until this day the man of sable hue had no
country, no glory.” He was in Boston when
the tidings of the Emancipation Proclamation
reached that city and described the universal
joy which prevailed. We must fight for prac
tical equality with industry, loyalty and
wealth. We were given liberty without any
of the props of liberty. To-day there are
200,000 colored children in the schools of the
laud—twenty years ago there were none. The
race would yet vindicate its capacity and con
found its (memies.
Hon John R. Lynch
was hope iul of the progress of the race in
Mississippi The name of Frederick Doug
lass was a household word in many sections
of his state; it served as an inspiration to his
people. In his opinion colored men would
not only lead society—but represent the
wealth of that section in the future. Colored
men will reaich the greatest measure of honor
and success in the south. The very opposi"
tion which we encounter in this country is a
stimulus which will spur us on. So far as the
colored people of the south were concerned,
they are a grateful people. There is no name
they venerate more, or speak of oftener, than
that of the distinguished guest of the even
ing. |
Houl John P. Green,
member of they Ohio Legislature, said that
the colored man (as a legislator was an experi
ment. He enumerated the galaxy of our legis
lators with pleasure. Hon Joseph H. Rainy
of South Carolins, had kept his honor bright
in the Congress on the Nation; Robert Browne
Elliott had stood like a pillar of fire in the
struggle for the civil rights of the race. Hon
B. K. Bruce, Hon John R. Lynch, Hon Rob’t
Smalls, and the long list of those men of the
race who had stood representativse in the na
tional legislature, rwere conspicuous for worth,
loyalty and ability. We live in an era filled
with hope and success for the colored man.
Dr H. T. Tanner
of the Christian Reorder gloried in the great
future for the colored press. He believed in
Americanization. The'' United States were
good enough for Rim. He was pleased that
neither Mr Garfield nor President Arthur had
alluded to the color question in their fl
messages. He took it as a good sign!
pictured in glowing terms the future 1
colored press. The sky was bright, th 3
was great, and he was not without hop!
the knights of the quill would rise e J
the occasion.

Profß. T. Greener
Was pleased to welcome the guest a
evening as the “Victor Hugo of the 1
race.” He pointed to Fred Douglass a
facile princeps of the race. The guest a
evening was among the very first indea

emancipate himself. It has been said
the republican party is a ship and all o
of it is sea, expanseless waters, and the c i
man was not likely to jump over-board
time. He would stick to the ship until I

Prof James M. Gregory i

were sustained by copious citations (of

to the efforts of Prof Gregory more than
other that the brilliant success of the ban
is due. He was fortunate in bringing ta I

in drawing out some of the best sentime 1

Gregory valuable assistance. 1

Political Opinion.
Among colored men in Washington thereM
widespread feeling of unrest and uncertaifl
nor did we find that unanimity of opiJl
which has so long been characteristic of 31
people and place. Confidence in Mr Arthurt
administration has been so violently shakei
that very little remains. He has shown su<^
lofty disregard of the race, has srcrificed it 9
Washington and in the states to such exten
that the conviction prevails in Washingtoi
that he is not disposed to conciliate the rac
in any way. Smothered indignation reacl
us from many quarters, while perplexitfl
to the future is the most common sentinel
with which we came into contact. No II
seemed to look with confidence on the fu|
policy of the party. But I could see afl
ance, an independence, in certain quar|
which will injure the party unless it is ctfl
teracted. il
Governor Cleveland is a modest executj
not given to long-winded recommendations
the legislature with which he is not intina
ly acquainted, and he does not appear ■
intimately acquainted with any of the
of the state, since he makes no recommen
tion worthy of comment. There are v
few lawyers in the state who are notthorouj
ly acquainted with its present needs, and v
could not, as governor, suggest measures
legislation and make recommendations sucl
would commend themselves to the people
the state. Modesty may be a corn mend J
virtue, but it can be carried to a point vn
unpardonable ignorance is displayed. 1
