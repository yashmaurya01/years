JACGb LATTIMER, THE MIL
LIONAIRE;
"•r the Acquisition of Weath does not
Always Bring F/ ppiness.—Fom'i
ed on Facts.
BYK. H. VAN DYNe.
Part IX.
She knew that a false interpretation would
be placed upon her conduct, believed that
others would secretly endeavor to poison his
mind, “but,” said she, “it is nothing more
than my contract before marriage; my hus
band does not care for operas, theatres, art
galleries, lectures, nor amusements of any
kind. He never cares to ride in our carriage,
and what pleasure can I find in his society?
None, positively none! and what, have I sold
my liberty, my life, my happiness upon eafth
destroyed and jeopordized for eternity! I
thought once that to secure wealth I could
risk every thing, but have now learned to my
sorrow that I have made the greatest mistake
of my life, the prospective happiness of my
young life is destroyed by this false and fatal
step — 1 union of hands, but not of hearts. He
married my beauty,—l married his money.
When his money is gone, he is in feelings to
me no longer my husband. When my beauty
fails, he has nothing to admire, nothing par
ticular to be proud of, and he will not hesi
tate to dictate to me as one of his employes,
will compel me to step down from my high
pedestal and live as he from boyhood up to
manhood, —a trifle better than a beggar. To
leave him will open the door to scandal. No,
I must continue on in my misery; must suffer
for vanity, praying the Almighty to hasten
my rdief from this thraldom.”
We will now look into the private room of
Jacob Lattimer. We find him pacing up
and down the room, running his fingers
through his hair, soliloquising. Is this the
happiness recommended by Colonel Hamilton?
Is this what I have save ! up for? “Is this
what I have labored day and night, in sea
son and out for? Foresworn father, mother,
sister, brothers; forsaken the Christian teach
ings of my childhood days to save for such a
one to prodigally waste on those that care
still less for, me than she does herself? All
of ventures nowaday’s fail me; everything is
against me; if there is for a eertainty an al
mighty Creator that holds individuals to an
accountability, is he punishing me for fail-
ing to do that which my humble talents and
meansjwould have admitted had I bean so dis
posed. If so what will be my end? All that
I thought was mine, and what I supposed I
should never be able to spend the interest on
is fast melting away. If so disposed to re
trace my omissions it is now too late; I have
qpthiug to give away. Last year my losses
footed up fully one million dollars, and this
year nearly as much. This womon of mine
has run up enormous bills at dry goods houses,
at shoe stores, at tailor shops, for new liv
eries for coachman, footman and waiter
men, new and expensive horses have now
been purchased the third time since w r e were
married, the bills at the summer resorts for
herself, ven nurse, maid, coachman, footmen’
<o ich horses, riding horse, sisters, brother-in,
law, all are fast undermining the wealth that
I believed could never be disturbed, and who
is there in this world feels that through my
efforts they have been benefitted. The poor
have cried unto me daily, and I have closed
my eyes and ears to their wail. My heart
never knew what pity meant. What benevo-
lent or Christian institution has ever derived
a dollar’s assistance or benefit from the great
wealth I once poss ssed? It is true I paid
my servants their earnings, but not a dollar
over; they owe me no love, no gratitude, no
good wishes, no sorrow or even regret for my
misfortunes. I dare not open my heart, make
known ray losses to my heartless wife, she
would dispise me more than ever now. Oh!
Misery; misery! to whom shall I look for
consolation; ray fortune is quite exhausted;
I dare not let it be known on the street, on
change, at the banks; if I do, immediate ruin
will be the result. My God ! my God ! why
am I thus persecuted? What have I done
that punishment is thus meted out to me ?
Can it be the blood money taken from the
murdering of those poor Negroes brought over
by Fernandez ? ” To whom can 1 appeal?
Thus and more was the long and silent or
secret soliloqury of Jacob Lattimer.
At last he decided to cast himself upon the
charity of his wife, she must be human. She
was the mother of his only son. If she had
no sympathy, no mercy, he was done strug
gling against fate. The next day instead of
going down to Wall street as was common or
usual, he remained at home. When called
down to breakfast he returned answer that he
■would not be down. Mrs Lattimer came
down to breakfastjas usual, looking finer and
apparently more beautiful than ever, and af
ter partaking very heartily, returned to her
room. Mr Lattimer remained in his room,
(for the two always, from the second year af
ter married). At lunch time Mrs Lattimer
sent the servant to his room to announce
lunch, but his reply was that “I shall not
need lunch.” After the family had lunched
Mr Lattimer rang his bell for the servant, who
soon made her appearance. He said to her,
“Elleaze, say to Mrs Lattimer that I desire to
see her in my room, if she will oblige me, as
soon as it is convenient.” In about five min
utes she presented herself. “Well, Mr Latti
mer, what new idea has struck you that you
have remained at home to-day? You certain
ly must be ill,'or have decided to make your
will?” ‘1 beg your pardon madam, I have
not sent for you to solve any conundrum, but
to make a serious and melancholy revelaiion,
and I hope you will exhibit* the feelings
that I have a right to expect from a wife of
reason and human feelings.” She laughed
right out at this sermon, as she termetfit, as
Mr Lattimer seldom for years answered any
thing or anybody more than yes or no. She
replied to him, as she saw a terrible look in
his eyes. “Why what do you mean by address
ing me in this way, Augustina?” “I mean
nothing more nor less than that through mis
calculations and otherwise, I have lost every
dollar I once possessed, and to-day or to-mor
row the public journals will teem with
the failure of Jacob Lattimer & Co. Now
under the circumstances what have you to
say, and what will you do? I can no longer
lavish upon you nor our dear boy the means to
keep you as heretofore. My age will not ad
mit of my again commencing life at the foot
of the ladder. I have no capital with which
to start the most simple or unpretentious bus
iness. What, oh what are we to do? In the
name of all that is good and merciful, what
can you, in this my bitter, my terrible trial
by misfortunes recommend?” He placed his
hands over his eyes and wept like a child.
She, with the airof an empress with freezing
-east of countenance deliberately informed him
2utshe with her son Willie, after gathering all
that could be conveniently turned to money,
would go to her father’s house and make that
her future home, and by the sale of her val
uable jewelry, which in better days had cost
Mr Lattimer not less than $150,000, would
henceforth support her; and as for himself he
had better seek to find a home at one of his
brothers. The diabolical selfishness shown,
regardless of him in his old age, was a blow
he could not rally under; he fainted lifeless,
to all appearance, he lay stretched out on the
floor. To prevent a scene, and close the
mouths of indiscreet servants, she hoped to be
able to bring him too without aid; but after
several applications of first one and another
remedy resorted to in such cases, she was at
last obliged to call in a physician, who, after
much trouble succeeded in restoring anima
tion, but his reason was gone. Several phy
sicians were invited to a consultation. They
without a single dissenting voice pronouncetl
him insane. The once famous banker, the
Napoleon of Wall street, was as simple as an
infant. A second examination decided that
his case was one of the incurables, and re
commended his being placed in the Blooming
dale asylum for the insane. Thus ended the
career of the once successful financier and
eminent banker. In gathering wealth he
took precedence over all of his associates in
early life, but at the price and sacrifice of hap
piness, he died unwept, unmourned and
friendless. At a time when fortune smiled
brightest upon Mr Strathmore he was called
from time to eternity, died suddenly in the
arduous pursuit of wealth.
Thomas McClarry, looking forward to great
happiness in his old age, unfortunately met
with a series of losses by death and finan
cially, which blighted his life, causing gall to
fill life’s chalice instead of that nectar pro
ducing immortality and never ending happi
ness. His daughter, Augustina, made a sad
mistake in her choice of life companion with
wealth in preference to unquestioned prin
ciple and educational equality.
She was never truly happy after the first
week of the marriage. For twenty years she
lived a life of mental misery, feeling the in
equality existing between them as to age,
social tastes, and literary acquirements. In
fact his whole disposition was on totally at
variance in every particular with hers.
To live surrounded with ordinary neces
saries for comfort, money is unquestionably
requisite, and is often obtained only by much
labor and many sacrifices, but genuine happi
ness cannot at all times be purchased with
money. A wedded life is often more miser
able from the possession of vast wealth where
heartlessness follows than poverty where true
Christian character dwells.
The great mistake of men’s lives is to dis
burse through executors of will after death,
that over which they are powerless, person
ally, to either retain control or distribute.
They miss the gratification to themselves
while living Of witnessing happiness con
ferred upon many an unfortunate whose
moral existence might for years be prolonged
to watch over and care for those that help to
make up for the world at large, and contri
bute to the welfare of this country or its crim
inal records. If it be true that God has
given one man ten talents and another man
one, why should all men be expected, even
with the one and same opportunity to ac
complish the same ends regardless of
superior ability on the part of one, and inferior
or less talents on the part of the other. But
happiness certainly eminates from the satis
faction of having done right, having dis
charged the duties faithfully intended by
him who controls man’s destiny.
Let us then accord to all that justice that
we claim for ourselves as we journey through
life, remembering that we are not p’aced
here and permitted to live for ourselves alone,
but to our fellow man as our neighbor are
we obligated. Man is intended to be instru
mental in the accomplishment of the will of
Divine Providence or its furtherance, and if
he fails to recognize his mission through will
ful ignorance and selfish indulgence will not
God punish him for his sins of omissions?
Then inasmuch as Jacob Lattimer failed to
do God’s service, punishment was severely
dealt out to him. The visitation of judg
ment was slow, but came when he was the
least able to abide it, when a Christian’s
hope and consolation would probably have
saved him much pain and bitterness, when
he could have found happiness in the satis
faction of still having treasures beyond this
world where no one could despoil him of
them.

New London Letter.
New London, Jan 2, 1883.—The Metro
politan custom of making and receiving calls
on the first day of the year was very generally
observed in this city. The gallants were out in
lull force, while most of our city bells and es
teemed matrons were at home receiving their
callers in a becoming manner. Prominent
among whom were Mrs and Miss Louise Batus
at their residence on Cedar street, Mrs and
Miss Angeline Hutchings on Chappell street-
Mrs John Ailer, Hempstead street; Madani
I 001, cor of Prospect street and Bulkley ave ■
Mrs and Miss Emma Lewis, William street
On Sunday a select company of invited guests
were entertained at dinner at the residence of
Mr Titus Batus. The menu was exqaisitelv
fine and was spread m the host’s well,known
superior manner. The company was composed
ot Mr and Mrs Wm Hicks. Mr and Mrs Fred
Randall, Madam Parlin and The Globe man’
Thejattendance at the entertainment at Mission’
Chapel on Wednesday evening was very small
A program of very rare excellence was pre
sented in a manner that would have done credit
to a company of professionals. The solo ‘Take
back the heart” was exquisitely rendered by
Miss Lavinia Ross. The solo by Messrs Wm
and John Jordan was also finely rendered. As
a whole the entertainment was a success and

the committee are entitled to considerable
credit. Mr Frank Jones the popular head
waiter of theCrocker House was presented with
one of ‘•Dunlap’s” best silk hats on Christmas,
as a slight token of the esteem in which hets
held by those in his employ. Chas Allen the
young man who frezed his feet last winter and
was obliged to have one amputated, has been
supplied by his friends with an artificial limb
and “is able to resume his labors again in the
Telegram Press Room.” About fifteen couples
attended the surprise party Christmas night at
the residence of Mr Fred Xandall. They were
pleasantly received and everything was done
by the genial host and hostess to have all enjoy
a pleasant evening. The Rev W. E. Walker, of
Trenton, N. J., passed through this city last
Thursday enroute to Middletown, Conn. A
great many will visit Hartford to-morrow to
witness the inauguration of Gov Waller. We
advise the readers of The Globe to make a
specialty of reading the Governor’s address as
we are positive they will find something in it
thst has a bearing on an important subject that
should have been remedied by his predecessors.

Hartford, Jan I.—As usual the holidavs
brought in a deluge of amusements to our gen -
erally quiet city. The event of the week was
the familiar andevei welcome opera “Trova
tore,” by Mapleson’s grand selection of artists.
Never was this standard work so finely render
ed here. The fair at the Pearl street Methodist
church was very successful financially. The
Waiter’s Protective Union give a reception on
Jan 3. The Sumner Club has secured the Hen
Frederick Douglass to deliver a lecture at Allyn
Hall, Jan 10, subject: “The lifeot John Brown.”
On the same evening a banquet will be given by
the club at the close of the lecture at the Put
nam Phalanx Armonry. The invitations are
gotten up in a manner reflecting much credit
upon thetas eol the committee. A fine litho
graph of the late Charles Sumner adorns the first
page. Mr Samuel Harris, of Boston, favored his
many friends here with a brief visit a,few days
since.
The marriage of Dr Anderson, of Warehouse
Point and Miss Adelphia Murray, of this cit;,
took place on the 27th ult. Mr Chaunay Dou
glass and Mrs Watson also entered the blissful
state on the 28th ult. The Rev R. R. Morris ofli

them in their affliction. This dreaded scourge
having entered their family. The Hon Charles
Mi chell, of Boston, spent a portion of the holi
days here, stopping at the United States Hotel.
It can be said to the credit of the first class ho
tels here that none of them hesitate to accom
modate guests of any race or color. Thesolemn
and impressive ceremony of watching the old
year out and the incoming of the New Year was
observed at the Pearl street Methodist Church,
Rev R. R. Morris, pastor. Callender’s Georgia
Ministrels attracted much attention on the
street this morning and they are sure to have a
large house to-night. Why is it that our people
flock to this style of amusement and have so fU
tle taste for any thing of an elevating tendency ?
The decision of Judge Parkes, of the Supieme
Court, that the black ballots used by the demo
crats, at New Haven, in the late city election
are illegal has caused a great sth throughout
tne state. It is rumored that an effort is to be
made to obtain a like decision against tne whole
state tiiket, thus giving the principal state offi
ces to the republican parly. The better element
of thepaity, much to their credit, say it would
not be right to set aside the will of the people
by such action. The counting in of Mr Hayes as
Presipent and its effect upon the country is
still iresh in the memory of all and the lesson
than taught, the party leaders can not afford to
forget it, if they would carry the state in 1884.

Hudson, Jan 2.—Your correspondent and
patrons of The Globe, in this vicinity, send
The Globe a Christmas greeting and wish ail
a happy New Year. 1 have been requested to
write, (by a large number of people here), that
parents, gaurdians and the public, are called to
the follewing iacts: that a truthful charge of
rape and seduction has been preferred against
Elder Simon F. Dickson, of the A. M E. Zion
connection, of the northern district of New
York. He was brought to a partial trial by the
ehurch. The victim’s (a mere girl) evidence
was immutable, nevertheless the ministerial
cloak of not guilty was thrown over his head,
thereby covering up his dirty and shame faced
actions of immorality, by the bias committee of
three. The public is cautioned against him
wherever he may be stationed.

Newark Letter.
Newark, Jan 1,1883. —In keeping of the
custom many persons gathered at the various
churches last Sunday night to “watch the old
year out and the new year in.” The services
which were ail well conducted were divided
into three parts, preaching, prayer, and class
meeting. The house of God was respected and
many went down there from with their minds
intent on better resolutions. Please insert the
following clipping for the pleasure of many
Newark readers ot The Globe.
“All promenade,” were the words that greeted
the ears of a Register reporter as he looked in
at Apollo Hall on the J. M. Baxter Association
late last even ng, and to a “lively measare” by
Voss’ orchestra, the command was carried out
to the letter, with a grace and execution that
would have done credit to any ball room in the
land. Glancing about the room the following
familiar faces were seen: Mr and Mrs. J. M.
Baxter. Mr and Mrs Charles Nevins, Mr and
Mrs H Jones, Mr and Mrs J. Henry, Mr and Mrs
James Grant,-t he Misses Sears and Stanley. Miss
Nellie Mason, Miss Francisco, Mrs Ricks, Miss

It was the first annual reception and ball of
theJ.M. Baxter Association, an organization
comprising a number of the tirst young colored
gentlemen of Newaik, and the air of refinement
that surrounded the occasion told plainly that
it is not always for those who, by birth, wealth
or education are admitted to genteel society, to
claim that “thus far shall others come and no
farther.” Never has a merrier party danced
upon the floor ot Apollo Hall; never has a social
assembly in tins town produced a larger num
ber of gentlemen and ladies in the nue mean
ing of the respective terms. The management
of the sociable was entrusted to the following
committees, who did their work well, and con
sequently made everyone happy; Floor com
miitee—F. F. Nichols, James Grant, E. T.White.
Arrangement commitee—F. H. Eilis, F. H. Gor

Chicago Letter.
Chicago, Dec 26.—At the residence of
Mr Sylvester W Light, an old Knickerbocker, a
gentleman well known in the city of New York,
and who has resided inChicago for the past two
y ears,was a small gathering of old friends from
the east on Christinas day, to celebrate it by
partaking of a Christmas dinner and to have a
pleasant chat over eastern news. etc. The
hostess Mrs Light was deserving great credit
for the successful manner in which the affair
was conducted, the host being unable to be
present on account of urgent business. The
table fairly groaned under the weight of the
mammoth turkey and the delicacies of tile sea
son and the guests showed their appreciation
by making things look small in Gue seasont
Several toasts were drunk. Among the guest

Mrslereßeiisen, Chicago, formerly from N. Y.,
Mr Harvey Green,of New York; Mr Daniel Fry,
New York; Thomas. Whilliams, Chicago; Mr
Jas H. Elliott, of San Francisco; Mr Sedgemok
Jamieson telegraphed his regret, he having

train rom Peoria, HU
After wishing the hostess a merry Christmas
and a happy New Year the guest departed with
regrets, in the wee small hours, and strolled
home to dream of turkev, egg-nogg, etc.
Mr Joseph Marshall, the efficient and highly
esteemed head-waiter of the Leland Hotel, of
this city, wai very pleasantly surpiiied New
Year’s evening by the young men in iiis em
ploy, who presented him with an elegant
Japanese set as a testimonal of their regard for
him. The presentation was made in choice
language by Mr. John Sanders, on behalf of the
young men, and received a neat reply from
the grateful beneficiary. The whole affair
took place at the Leland and was highly en
enjoyed by all participants. P. Williams.
