A. M. E. Zion Church.
Rev Dyson preached Sabbath morning, a
memorable sermon from Exodus xv-3. “The
Lord is a man of war, the Lord is his name.”
He said that Moses w*as divinely called by
God for special purposes. He reviewed the
history of the Israelites while in Egypt, from
their advent to their exodus; recounted their
many wrongs and oppressions, under which
they labored, of their groans and cries com
ing up before the Lord. Then of the call of
Moses who was in the land of Midian, feeding
his father’s flock; spoke of the reluctance of
Moses to accept the commission and of God’s
assurance. He graphically described the
plagues which were sent upon Egypt which
compelled Pharoah to let the Israelites de
part. But the most interesting portion of his
discourse was the consternation of the Israel
ites when at the Red Sea, which prevented
their advance, while their enemies were ad
vancing, threatening their destruction. Their
miraculous deliverance was grandly portrayed,
as was also the joy which pervaded their
hearts after the destruction of their enemies.
Mr Dyson then made a very practical appli
cation of his sermon, impressing his hearers to
trust in God; reminding them that the
“Lord is a man of war, and that the Lord is
his name.”
Rey Rawlins occupied the pulpit in the af
ternoon, and preached from Jeriv-6. The ser
vices in the evening at 9 o’clock; the church
was then filled to its utmost capacity, soon
after the trustees were compelled to close the
doors and several hundred persons remained
outside until a very late hour. Rev Dyson
preached the sermon from Prov xxix-1. “He
that being often reproved hardeneth his neck,
shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without
remedy.” The speaker was listened to with
marked attention.

On Sunday evening the Ladies’ Union pre
sented a Christmas purse of $201.16 to their
pastor, RevD. W. Wisher, whose earnest la
bors and Christian conduct and zeal have en
deared him to the people of his vast congrega
tion and to the good people of New York gen
erally. Last Tuesday evening the Sunday
school of the church, under the superintend
ency of Mr B. H. Stone, had their Christmas
tree. The demonstration was largely attend
ed, and the success of the broom-stick drill,
under the captaincy of Miss Lucy Brander,
was complete. The whole entertainment was
replete with pleasure and instruction. Mr
Wisher desires to thank the ladies of the
Union for their generous gift.
THE NEW YORK GLOBE: SATURDAY, JANUARY 6, 1883.
St. Augustine Church, Brooklyn.
Christmas Day was ushered in by celebra
tion of the Holy Communion and was largely
attended by the faithful. In the evening a
large congregation assembled to hear the most
e fficient choir of this prosperous mission un
der the direction of Miss Ella A. Wright, an
organist of very fine taste and ability. The
choir is composed of Miss C. D. Anderson
and Mrs Fred Wells, soprano; Mrs C. Chivers
and Miss Mary E Williams, altos; M. J.
Hamm, tenor; James Green, baritone, and
Percy Wells, basso. We can safely assert
there was no finer singing north of Washing
ton. The sermon delivered by the pastor, P.
A. Morgan, was one of his grandtst efforts.’
The text was taken fron Proverbs, xxv., 8:
“ As cold water to a thirsty soul, so is good
news from a far country.”
BETHEL CHURCH.
Last Words!—Pastor Stewart’s Fare-
In the morning Rev W. L. Hunter of
Weeksville, preached a very eloquent and stir
ringsermon from Prov xii. 1—“ A good name
is rather to be chosen than great riches.” Six
persons joined the church on probation.
At night a large congregation gathered.
Rev T. McCants Stewart read several persons
into full membership; and made what he call
ed his last talk.. He took no text, reading as
his last scripture lesson I Cor ii. He said that
his pastorate, in the main, had been very
pleasant, and that his labors were not with
out results, which made him thankful to God
and grateful to those members and friends
who had co-operated with him. During his
pastorate of two years and a half, two hun
dred persons had been added to the church,
the additions having been mainly from Sab
bath to Sabbath and from week to week,
there having been no special revival; nearly
$25,000 had been collected for all purposes;
about $7,000 had been paid on the principal
and interest of the bonded debt; the annual
interest had been reduced from $1,020 to
S6OO, and the rate from 6 per cent to 5 per
cent; the church and the entire property had
been thoroughly renovated and refurnish
ed and nearly $2,000 collected on the cost of
the renovations; the church had been kept in
good spiritual condition, the meetings being
well attended; and he saw no reason why
under his successor, the work may not be
pushed rapidly forward. He exhorted the
church to take whomever the bishop might
appoint warmly by the hands, and stand °by
him in the spirit of unity, love and peace.
He paid a high tribute to his predecessor,
Bishop Dickerson, and said that the future of
Bethel would be brighter, more useful and
more glorious than her past if officers and
people would be faithful to God. He called
attention to the fact that the clerk reported
to the last official Board that $690 of his sal
ary had been paid, leaving a balance of S3O
which has been made up. He then exhorted
the unconverted to come to Christ and read
several of the many letters approving his go
ing to Africa. The following are a few ex
tracts, which will be perused with interest:
Bishop Brown writes: You have my best
wishes and ray prayers that God may preserve and keen
you, and make you even more useful In our ancestral
land than you have Deen In the land of your birth.
Bishop Payne: If the Lord Jesus has
summoned you to the African field, 1 say “ Go ?” and
may He be your Counsellor, your Guide and your
Gracious Commander. Then shall you be more useful
In Africa than your ardent heart has dared to hope. The
Lord be with thee, my dear son Thomas. O may He be
the strength of your heart and your portion forever
Bishop Wayman: May the God of Jacob
go with you across the ocean.
Bishop Dickerson: Honors and emoluments
await you here. Why this ? But you will stand In the
faculty as an African Methodist. It may be that through
you, God will solve the problem for us, the prob
lem of an effective superintendency of our work in Af
rica.
Rev Dr James H. A. Johnson, editor of
the African Methodut: America will not be bettered bv
your departure however much Africa may be Improved
by your arrival. I am almost constrained to say,—O,
dear brother, don’t go. But my prayers are that you
may be protected, guided and preserved whithersoever
you may go.
Mr Sam 1 J. Stokeley: I feel that the
church and the community at large can ill afford to lose
the benefits of your progressiveness at this time. lam
conscious, however, that the field into which you are
about to enter Is one of the grandest proportions. May
the almost phenominal success that has attended you
here be equalled in far off Africa.
Prof W. M. Dart of Columbia, S. C: I re
gret, to have you go so far from us. Bat the true friend
should never be actuated by selfish m.tives. For this
reason I reluctantly, yet, as cheerfully as possible, bld
you adieu and a hearty God-speed.
Miss Hallie Q. Brown, the distinguished
elocutionist of Wilberforce University, Ohio: At first
I was horrified, then surprised; then af‘er looking the
matter fairly and squarefy in the face, 1 said a great
loud “ Amen,” that came from the very bottom of my
heart.
Prof D. A. Shaker, Dean of the Law De-
Sartment, Allen University, Columbia, S. C:lamun
eclded as to the wisdom of your case except as the
path of duty directs you. Along with you and Prof
Brown ought to go $50,000 to be expended in manufacto
ries, farming, etc., then education will live.
Rev B. W. Arnett, Nashville. Tenn.; I am
very sorry to think of you leaving this country, but
when 1 look at the matter in the light of the possibili
ties of the race and the responsibility of the young
men to God and the race, 1 am willing to send you my
hearty congratulations. Go and tell onr older brother
that he must educate the mind to think, she heart to
love and the hands to work for God and the race, and
may the presence of the Holy One of Zion be with you.
Dr Blyden writes: I have discovered in the
south a great and growing Interest in the redemption of
Africa. Several students have decided to go to Liberia
and complete their studies in Liberia College. Atlanta
University, Ga., will furnish 2; Clark University, 2-
Baptist University, Richmond, Va., 8; Biddle Univer
sity, 2; Hampton Institute, 12. At Hampton several fe
male students put their names down to go to work in
Liberia when through their studies.
The services all day were full of special in
terest. 30 persons were admitted into the
church on trial, and 12 were taken into lull
membership. Dr D. K. McDonald, the emi
nent physician, united with Bethel. There
was much rejoicing. Many wept aloud.
Prof Stewart will leave on the 10th inst., for
Columbia, S. C., where he will settle his
family.
A Grand Presentation.
A grand presentation took place at A. M.
E. Zion Church on last Friday evening, on
the occasion of the Christmas tree. Santa
Claus made his appearance about 9 o’clock,
heavily laden, and distributed his gifts to the
children of the Sabbath School; making their
little hearts leap for joy. The lecture room
of the church was filled to its utmost capacity
with the children, their parents, guardians
and friends. The most interesting features
however, were two grand presentations, one
to Madam Virginia Setigee, the soprano sing,
er of the church, and the other to Rev R. H.
G. Dyson, the pastor. Mr E. V. C. Eato,
president of the board of trustees, in behalf of
the donors presented Madam Setigee with a
very handsome gold watch, and made the
presentation speech. He paid a high compli
ment to that lady for the respect, esteem,
and appreciation, in which she is held by the
church and her many friends; and for her
sweet melodious voice, which charms and
enraptures all who hear it. Madam Setigee
was absent owing to indisposition; so Madam
Burton, the organist, received the watch in
her behalf, and made a very neat and terse
address in reply. The donors were the trus
tees and clerk of the church, Mesdames
well!
